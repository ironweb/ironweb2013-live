      title: "Mission : Open311 in Quebec"
      text: |
        <p>Last year, our Iron Web teams used City data to build their applications.
          This year, we plan to go a little further!</p>
        <p>Team participants will allow you to send your own data to the City, thanks to <a href="http://open311.org/">Open311</a>,
          a standard allowing cities to receive citizens’ requests (report graffiti or various damages, etc.).
          At the outcome of the Iron Web event, attendees will have the tools to send their requests to
          Ville de Québec directly from the Web.</p>
        <p>Ville de Québec took inspiration from major cities like San Francisco, Chicago, Boston and several others,
          and will soon become the first French-speaking city to implement an Open311 system.</p>
        <p>This year, Ville de Québec therefore asked participants to develop a multiplatform Web application
          (mobile, tablet, desktop) allowing citizens to send their requests directly to the Open311 system.</p>

      text: |
        <p>This is a 3-day competition held for a third year, in parallel with the
          <a href="http://webaquebec.org">Web à Québec</a>.</p>
        <p>The goal is to develop a Web application. Live from Espace 400e Bell, two teams will put
          their imagination and talent to the test and meet the challenge.</p>
        <p>Watch live as these two teams of six Web professionals (designers, integrators, programmers, etc.)
          work hard to carry out their project, from design to production to delivery, and even public
          presentation at the closing of the event.</p>
        <p>This is a key event 24h/24h, starting Wednesday, February 20 at 10h00, where you’ll find out
          how Web professionals are creative individuals enjoying a versatile career that’s not just about
          typing on keyboards!</p>
